# Roadmap

OpenPencil is moving toward production-grade Figma compatibility while keeping design documents programmable, local-first, and fast on large files.

## Current focus

- Improve `.fig` import/export fidelity against real Figma files and Figma's own rendering.
- Keep large design systems responsive in the browser and desktop app.
- Treat the scene graph as a programmable design document: every important read, write, export, diff, and validation operation should be reachable through UI, CLI, MCP, and SDK surfaces.
- Keep files on the user's machine unless collaboration is explicitly enabled.

## Near-term work

### Figma fidelity

- Preserve and round-trip more Figma metadata safely.
- Add visual regression coverage for full multi-page `.fig` documents.
- Close high-impact renderer gaps: remaining mask edge cases, blend isolation, pattern fills, and broader variable-font fixtures.
- Improve boolean operation editing/export now that imported Figma `BOOLEAN_OPERATION` nodes remain boolean operations.

### Editor depth

- Complete variable inspector coverage for common numeric/text/layout fields.
- Improve component and instance editing: variant switching, property editing, and override inspection.
- Add first-class layout grid and guide rendering/editing.
- Expand vector editing workflows without regressing imported vector fidelity.

### Agent workflows

- Polish the official `SKILL.md` guidance for OpenPencil so agents use the full inspect → act → render/measure → compare → iterate loop instead of relying on one-shot prompting.
- Publish tested AI workflow recipes for common tasks: create from prompt, edit a selected design, compare against a screenshot or Figma reference, fix visual regressions, extract tokens, and batch-migrate files.
- Make agent workflows measurable by default: every substantial operation should be able to produce a render, structured diff, lint result, or comparison artifact.
- Keep MCP, CLI, and SDK operations aligned so agent skills can run the same workflow in desktop, browser, CI, or headless file mode.

### Tooling and API parity

- Maintain a public tool/API reference that maps editor operations to CLI commands, MCP tools, SDK APIs, and Figma Plugin API-compatible eval usage.
- Add coverage tests that detect when a core editor capability exists in the UI but is missing from CLI/MCP/SDK, or vice versa.
- Keep tool outputs structured enough for agents to chain safely: node IDs, bounds, diffs, render artifacts, diagnostics, and machine-readable error details.
- Improve deterministic CLI/MCP export and comparison tools for CI.
- Add more design linting and migration helpers for batch `.fig` and `.pen` workflows.
- Package desktop-side MCP integration so local agent workflows do not require global installs.

### Performance and scale

- Incremental layout and render invalidation for large documents.
- Better renderer profiling surfaces for slow nodes, effects, masks, and imported files.
- Smarter raster/retained caching that preserves fidelity during zoom and pan.

### Interactive shader layers

- Add Unicorn Studio-style shader scenes as first-class design layers: animated gradients, particles, noise fields, metaballs, lighting, displacement, and pointer-reactive backgrounds.
- Provide a preset-first editor for common generative visuals before exposing raw shader code.
- Support timeline and interaction inputs such as time, pointer position, scroll, layer bounds, colors, variables, and imported image textures.
- Render shader layers through CanvasKit/WebGL while keeping deterministic raster export for PNG/JPG/WEBP and thumbnails.
- Store shader layer configuration in OpenPencil documents and export graceful fallbacks when a target format cannot preserve the live effect.

## Later

### SDK and embedded editor

- Document the Vue SDK and core subpath exports as a platform for custom editor shells, embedded design surfaces, and automation-specific UIs.
- Provide examples for embedding OpenPencil in product tools: read-only previews, editable canvases, design review surfaces, and agent-controlled editors.
- Keep the renderer, editor core, and tool registry framework-agnostic enough for headless and embedded use.

### Product depth

- Prototyping: frame connections, triggers, overlays, transitions, and preview mode.
- Comments: pins, threads, resolution state, and collaboration-aware display.
- Shared libraries: publish, consume, and update components/styles across files.
- Platform polish: Windows code signing, PWA support, packaged updater improvements, and desktop-side MCP bundling.

## Non-goals

- Cloud-first storage or mandatory accounts.
- Read-only automation surfaces that cannot modify documents.
- Feature work that sacrifices `.fig` import/export fidelity for convenience.

This section tracks OpenPencil's current compatibility with Figma Design features. It is based on Figma's public Help Center feature areas and the current OpenPencil scene graph, Kiwi import/export, CanvasKit renderer, UI panels, CLI, and MCP tools.

Legend:

- **✅ Supported** — implemented for common files and expected to work directly.
- **◐ Partial** — implemented for important cases, but missing parity, UI, or edge-case behavior.
- **↩ Round-trip only** — imported/preserved/exported for `.fig` fidelity, but not rendered or editable as a first-class OpenPencil feature.
- **— Not supported** — not currently modeled or intentionally out of scope.

## Official Figma feature areas

Figma's design documentation groups features into these areas:

- Layers, frames, groups, sections, shape layers, text, vectors, and boolean operations.
- Fills, gradients, images, patterns, blend modes, strokes, effects, corner radius, and corner smoothing.
- Auto layout: vertical, horizontal, wrap, grid, padding, gap, hug/fill/fixed/min/max, and ignore auto layout.
- Components, instances, variants, component properties, slots, libraries, and library updates.
- Variables: color, number, string, boolean, collections, modes, aliases, scopes, and prototype variables.
- Prototyping: flows, hotspots, triggers, actions, overlays, smart animate, easing, conditionals, expressions, and variable actions.
- Dev Mode: inspect, measurements, annotations, Code Connect, dev resources, ready-for-dev states, and Figma MCP.
- Collaboration/file workflows: comments, version history, thumbnails, branches, library publishing, and multiplayer metadata.

## Raw Kiwi metadata coverage

OpenPencil deliberately preserves many Figma/Kiwi fields even when they are not rendered or editable. These live under `SceneNode.source.fig` and are applied late during `.fig` export.

| Field group | Import/export | Render | UI | Fidelity impact |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `source.fig.rawSize` | ✅ | Indirect | — | Preserves original Figma size for round-trip. Cleared when size is edited. |
| `source.fig.rawTransform` | ✅ | Indirect | — | Preserves exact Figma transform. Cleared when transform is edited. |
| `source.fig.rawNodeFields` | ✅ | Mixed | — | Late-applied to exported NodeChange for round-trip fidelity; exhaustive raw-field round-trip tests guard schema drift. |
| `source.fig.layout` | ✅ | ✅ | ◐ | Preserves original Figma stack metadata while using normalized layout fields. |
| `source.fig.symbolOverrides` | ✅ | Indirect | — | Important for instance override fidelity. |
| `source.fig.componentPropAssignments` | ✅ | Indirect | ◐ | Used for component property fidelity; not raw-editable. |
| `source.fig.derivedSymbolData` | ✅ | Indirect | — | Critical for instance-derived geometry/layout/text. |
| `source.fig.derivedSymbolDataLayoutVersion` | ✅ | — | — | Figma bookkeeping. |
| `source.fig.uniformScaleFactor` | ✅ | Indirect | — | Important for scaled instances. |
| Style IDs: fill/stroke/text/effect/grid | ↩ | — | — | Preserves style linkage for Figma, but OpenPencil has no style manager yet. |
| Component property refs/defs/specs | ✅ | Indirect | ◐ | Full Figma component-property authoring is incomplete. |
| State-group metadata | ↩ | — | — | Preserved only. |
| Version/sort/publish/library metadata | ↩ | — | ◐ | Assets UI shows a subset; publish/update workflow is missing. |
| Variable and parameter consumption maps | ✅ | ◐ | ◐ | Filtered/preserved for safe round-trip; normalized bindings cover common cases. |
| Page fields: background, page type, guides | ↩ | ◐ | — | Background/page type/guides mostly round-trip. Guides are not rendered/editable. |
| Text internals: `textData`, layout versions, font version, derived data | ✅ | ✅ | — | Important for text fidelity; most internals are not editable. Imported derived text data, leading trim, decoration style, and semantic font metadata are preserved for round-trip when safe. |
| `fontVariations` | ✅ | ✅ | — | Variable font axes are imported, rendered, and exported for text nodes and style runs. |
| Raw paint/effect/vector/geometry payloads | ✅ | ✅ | ◐ | Converted fields render; raw payloads preserve Figma import/export details. |

## Highest-priority visual gaps

These are parsed or visible in Figma docs and most likely to cause visible differences in real design files:

1. **Masks** — tune remaining exact Figma stack semantics beyond common alpha/vector/luminance and consecutive-mask paths.
2. **Corner smoothing** — expand Figma fixture comparisons and tune remaining stroke/effect edge cases.
3. **Pattern/noise/custom fills** — replace the current solid-color fallback with Figma-oracle rendering for schema-level paint objects and transforms beyond image tile fills.
4. **Variable-font and rich text fixtures** — broaden real-file coverage for variable axes, derived text data, leading trim, decoration style, semantic font metadata, and additional OpenType feature metadata beyond common ligature toggles.
5. **Boolean operation editing** — improve inspector/tooling workflows for imported boolean-operation nodes.
6. **Layout grids and guides** — render/edit page guides and Figma layout grids, or clearly keep them round-trip-only.
7. **Full component property and slot workflows** — support authoring, not just preserving imported payloads.
8. **Prototype/media/interaction metadata** — schema now includes more interaction, media runtime, animation, and slide fields; start by preserving flows/connections/runtime metadata before building playback.
